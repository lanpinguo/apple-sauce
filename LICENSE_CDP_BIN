This Software License Agreement (the "Agreement") is a legal agreement between
you, Licensee and Broadcom Corporation, a California corporation with its
principal office at 5300 California Avenue, Irvine, California 92617
("Broadcom"). As used in this Agreement, "you" and "Licensee" mean the company,
entity or individual that is acquiring a license under this Agreement.

By downloading the software listed on Appendix A, and any updates thereto made
available by Broadcom pursuant to Section 7, ("Software") and associate
documentation ("Documentation"), you are agreeing that you will be bound by and
are becoming a party to this Agreement.  Software expressly excludes the open
source software listed on Appendix B ("Open Source Software"). If you are an
entity, and an individual is entering into this Agreement on your behalf, then
you will be bound by this Agreement when that individual downloads the Software.
When they do so, it will also constitute a representation by the individual that
s/he is authorized to bind you as a party to this Agreement. If you do not agree
to all of the terms of this Agreement, do not download the Software.

modules described in the Documentation ("Broadcom Chips"); (ii) reproduce and
distribute the Software, solely in object code form, incorporated into or
integrated with Developer Programs solely for use with Broadcom Chips.


2. PROPRIETARY RIGHTS. The Software and the Documentation are proprietary
products of BROADCOM. BROADCOM or its licensors will retain ownership of the
Software, the Software, Documentation and all patents, copyrights, trade secrets
and other proprietary rights relating thereto. Except as provided in Section 1
above, you have no right, title or interest in the Software or the
Documentation. You will own all rights, title and interest in and to the
Developer Programs you may develop, except for any libraries, data or code
included in the Developer Programs that are also included in the Software. You
hereby covenant that you will not assert any claim that the Software or
derivative works thereof created by or for BROADCOM infringe any intellectual
property right owned or controlled by You.

this Agreement. In such event, You will destroy all copies of the Software and
its component parts.


4. NO WARRANTY. THE SOFTWARE IS OFFERED "AS IS," AND BROADCOM PROVIDES AND
GRANTS AND YOU RECEIVE NO SUPPORT AND NO WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, BY STATUTE, COMMUNICATION OR CONDUCT WITH LICENSEE, OR OTHERWISE.

INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR OTHER DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED
AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING
NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE, ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR USE, REPRODUCTION, OR
DISTRIBUTION OF THE SOFTWARE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA AND LOSS
OF PROFITS, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES. THESE LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL
PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDYTO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

6. INDEMNIFICATION. You will indemnify, defend and hold harmless BROADCOM and
its employees, directors, representatives and agents ("Indemnified Parties") for
all losses, damages and all reasonable expenses and costs, including reasonable
attorneys' fees, incurred by them in any third party claim, suit or proceeding
based upon use or distribution of the Developer Programs or upon your breach of
your obligations under this Agreement; provided that the Indemnified Parties
give you written notice of any such claim, suit or proceeding within a
reasonable time and control of the defense thereof.

7. SUPPORT. Nothing in this Agreement shall obligate Broadcom to provide any
support for the Software. Broadcom may, but shall be under no obligation to,
correct any defects in the Software and/or provide updates to licensees of the
Software. In the event that BROADCOM elects to provide upgrades to the Software
in connection with any such support, such upgrades shall be included within the
definition of Software and shall be provided subject to the rights and
restrictions set forth in this Agreement. You shall, at it your own expense, be
solely responsible for providing technical support and training to your
customers for Developer Programs and/or Software, and BROADCOM shall have no
obligation with respect thereto. You shall be solely responsible for, and
BROADCOM shall have no obligation to honor, any warranties that you provide to
your customers or to end users with respect to the Software, derivative works,
or Developer Programs.  You shall defend any claim against BROADCOM arising in
connection with any such warranties, express, implied, statutory, or otherwise,
and shall pay any settlements or damages awarded against BROADCOM that are based
on any such warranties.

8. CONFIDENTIALITY.  You acknowledge and agree that the Software, any
documentation relating to the Software, constitute the confidential and
proprietary information of Broadcom, and that your protection thereof is an
essential condition to your use and possession of the Software. You shall retain
all Confidential Information in strict confidence and not disclose it to any
third party or use it in any way except as permitted by this Agreement without
Broadcom's express written consent. You will exercise at least the same amount
of diligence in preserving the secrecy of the Confidential Information as you
uses in preserving the secrecy of your own confidential information, but in no
event less than reasonable diligence.  Any breach of this Section 8 would cause
irreparable injury to BROADCOM for which no adequate remedy at law exists.
Therefore, you agree that equitable remedies, including injunctive relief and
specific performance, are appropriate remedies to redress any breach or
threatened breach of this Section 8, in addition to all other remedies available
to BROADCOM. You will not directly or indirectly disclose or provide a copy of
Software to any other infrastructure and/or networking silicon solution
provider.

return all copies of the Software.

10. U.S. GOVERNMENT RESTRICTED RIGHTS. The Software is a commercial product,

thereof, including technical data, by the Government is restricted in accordance
with Federal Acquisition Regulation ("FAR") 12.212 for civilian agencies and
Defense ("DFARS") 227.7202 for military agencies. The Software is "commercial
items," as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101, consisting of "commercial
computer software" and "commercial computer software documentation," as such
terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212. Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48
C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4, all U.S. Government End Users acquire

may not be limited to, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria. Further, You
acknowledge that these commodities, technology or software were exported from
the United States in accordance with the EAR. Diversion contrary to U.S. law is
prohibited. Notwithstanding other provisions of U.S. law, You acknowledge that
transfer or re-export to any country, entity, or person subject to U.S.
sanctions, a denial order, or identified in Country Group E, requires prior
authorization from the U.S. Government.

11. MISCELLANEOUS. This Agreement shall constitute the final, binding and entire
agreement of the parties, and supersedes all prior agreements or representations
oral or written regarding the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may not be
changed, terminated or amended except in writing signed by an authorized
representative of each party. The failure of either party to exercise any of its
rights will not constitute a waiver of such rights unless expressly agreed in
writing. Neither party may assign its rights or obligations under this
Agreement. In the event any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or
unenforceable, the valid or enforceable portion thereof and the remaining
provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect. Licensee and
Broadcom are independent contractors and nothing contained in this Agreement is
intended or shall be construed as creating a relationship of principal and
agent, employer and employee, or joint venture between the parties. Licensee is
not an agent of Broadcom for any purpose and has no power or authority, whether
apparent, actual, ostensible, or otherwise to bind or commit Broadcom to any
obligations in any way.  You may not assign, delegate or otherwise transfer,
whether by agreement, operation of law or otherwise, any right or obligation
hereunder without the express prior written consent of Broadcom, and any
attempted assignment, delegation or transfer without such consent shall be void.
This Agreement will be interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of
California except those relating to conflict of laws. Any suit hereunder will be
brought solely in federal or state courts in the County of Orange, California
and Licensee hereby submits to the personal jurisdiction hereof. The official
language of this Agreement is English.
