Loxigen-Artifacts
=================

This repository tracks the artifact generated by the
[Loxigen OpenFlow API generator](https://github.com/floodlight/loxigen).

On each successful integration, the generated artifacts are pushed
here, noting the corresponding loxigen commit in the commit message,
and tagging the result with a tag named loxi/${sha1}.
