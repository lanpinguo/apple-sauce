See TBD for details on Indigo-2 interfaces.

Each of the following components gets a header file.  These contain 
the prototypes of functions provided by that module across all the 
interfaces to which it connects.  In addition any defines related to
that component are given there.

The components include:

* forwarding
* of_state_manager
* of_connection_manager
* port_manager

In addition files are defined for the functions required by Indigo
components:

* error.h Definitions of error codes
* time.h Time related definitions
* memory.h Definitions of memory manipulation operations
* logging.h Definitions for logging primitives
* types.h Basic type definitions
