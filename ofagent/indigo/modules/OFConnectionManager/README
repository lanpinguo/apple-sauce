This module provides the services related to configuring, invoking and
maintaining OpenFlow protocol connections.  Most of the interfaces are
defined from the Indigo-2 OF Connection Manager component.  The only
additional interfaces provided are the usual implementation specific
init, enable and finish interfaces; and message tracing interfaces.

A simple state machine for the connection is described in the file
module/src/cxn_instance.c.

The module differentiates between listen and connect (aka active)
connections.  OpenFlow normally connects from the switch to the
controller.  Listen allows a listen connection, for example to support
a dpctl style connection.

Support is also provided for a local connection.  Again, this is
primarily to support dpctl style connections which do not expect to
complete a features request handshake before executing other 
operations.
