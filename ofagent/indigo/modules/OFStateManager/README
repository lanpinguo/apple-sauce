###############################################################################

The OFStateManager module implements the logic of the OpenFlow protocol. It
includes a flowtable optimized for the database-like queries of OpenFlow
control messages.

This module receives OpenFlow messages from the controller(s) via the
OFConnectionManager module. Depending on the message it may make calls
into the platform-specific Forwarding and PortManager modules. These calls
are usually asynchronous, allowing for easier hardware implementation.

Hardware (through the Forwarding and PortManager modules) can signal events
to OFStateManager through interfaces like indigo_core_packet_in. This module
will generate the appropriate OpenFlow messages and send them to the controller.

Platforms that use multiple threads to handle hardware events should ensure
mutual exclusion when making calls into OFStateManager. A common design is
to use a thread-safe queue to serialize messages from other threads, and
register an eventfd or pipe with SocketManager that is notified when a new
item is enqueued.
